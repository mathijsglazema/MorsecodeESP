# This file should only ignore things that are generated during a `x.py` build,
# generated by common IDEs, and optional files controlled by the user that
# affect the build (such as config.toml).
# In particular, things like `mir_dump` should not be listed here; they are only
# created during manual debugging and many people like to clean up instead of
# having git ignore such leftovers. You can use `.git/info/exclude` to
# configure your local ignore list.
